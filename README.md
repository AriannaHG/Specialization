# Specialization

## Grow your Power
What's that? You have a favorite class? But you've played it so much that there's nothing left to do? There's no point in gaining more experience with the class? You wish you could change how some of the skills worked? You wish you could make the class more powerful?

Then why not specialize?

**While you can swap between specializations at a Class Trainer (Or Class NPC) at any time, an Actor can only be specialized in one class at once, and skill points are not shared between Actors, nor are they shared between specializations.*

## Cross-Mod Support
Specialization supports Prominence's suite of class-adding mods, Gravekeeper, Mafe's class-adding mods and more.

**Place this mod towards the bottom of your load order, and after Classism, if installed. It will not be compatible with most other skill-changing mods.*
